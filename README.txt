The purpose of this project is to automate the searching of property locations given a parcel number. 
Every year, Pickens County holds a tax sale. They release a list of all the parcel numbers of houses available.
The problem is that a parcel number is not an address. To find the address, you have to navigate a clunky website
and search parcel numbers one at a time to find out the location of the property. 

This year, there were almost 600 records. After working through around 50 in an hour, I decided that the process
could be automated.
